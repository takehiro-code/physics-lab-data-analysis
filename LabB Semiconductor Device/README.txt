Project name: Lab B - Semiconductor Devices Experiment

Project Objective/Purpose: Objective is to determine the IV characteristics of resistor and diode and fit the appropriate model with the analysis of uncertainties. Then, see the difference between the non-semiconductor component and silicon-based semiconductor device, which is pn-junction diode.
