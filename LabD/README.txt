Project name: Lab D - Determination of Acceleration due to Gracity with Physical Pendulum

Project Objective/Purpose: Objective of this experiment is to measure periods dependence on different distances between pivot and the center of mass and estimate the acceleration due to gravity g. Two methods of photogate and stopwatch have been performed.
